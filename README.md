**Tic-Tac-Toe Project - Digital Ready 2024**

**Description**

Through our code, it provides an interactive console-based interface where two players can compete against each other. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking spaces with their symbols ('X' or 'O') aiming to achieve a winning combination of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The implementation ensures proper validation of moves and handles end-game conditions such as win, lose, or draw scenarios. The UI also keeps count of the current score and player turn that the players can view. Our code can be infinitely played until the users decide not to.

**How do I play?**

Start the game by clicking the programs start button. The game begins with an empty board ranging from 1 - 9 in which a random symbol or player goes first. Player inputs must be 1-9 and cannot replace an already existing symbol. Players will take turns until the game reaches a draw or if one of the players gets 3 of their symbols in a row.
